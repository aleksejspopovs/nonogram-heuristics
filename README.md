This is a [nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) solver that intentionally avoids advanced techniques like using SAT solvers and instead implements a collection of heuristics. It displays its progress as an animation and is meant to be somewhat fun to look at.

The example puzzles included with the solver are courtesy of users of [Web Paint-by-Number](https://webpbn.com/), individual credits are available in the file `js/puzzle_data.js` and when running the solver.
